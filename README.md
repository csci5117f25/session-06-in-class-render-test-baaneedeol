# Render-test
A basic website -- just enough to test out hooking things up to render, and not much more.

We will go over steps in lecture. You should fill out the following:

## What steps do I need to do when I download this repo to get it running?
1. Clone the repo: git clone <repo> (also ensure that you are in repo for path)

2. Set up the environment: pipenv install


## What commands starts the server?
pipenv run flask --app server.py run

## Before render

Before render you will need to set up a more production-grade backend server process. We will do this together in lecture, once that's done you should update the command above for starting the server to be the **production grade** server.
